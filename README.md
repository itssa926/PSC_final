## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the potential of using pre-mature stop codon (PSC) frequency to identify essential genes in _Anopheles gambiae_, the primary mosquito vector for malaria. By identifying these genes, we seek to propose potential targets for genetic biocontrol strategies aimed at managing the mosquito population and reducing the spread of malaria.

## Repository Structure

- **Code Folder**: Contains all the scripts and code used to generate the results presented in this project. The code is written in **R** and is structured to reproduce all analyses.
- **Data Folder**: Includes all datasets required to run the scripts. These datasets are preprocessed and formatted for analysis within this project.

## Technologies Used
- **R Programming Language**: For data analysis and statistical computation.


## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itssa926/PSC_final.git
   ```

2. **Run the Scripts**: Execute the R scripts from the code folder using your preferred environment (e.g., RStudio).
   ```r
   source("code/script_name.R")
   ```

## Data
The `Data` folder contains all the raw and processed datasets necessary to reproduce the analyses. Please refer to the individual files for more details on the data format and structure.
